Java allows for Covariant Return Types, which means you can vary your return type as long you are returning a subclass of your specified return type.

Method Overriding allows a subclass to override the behavior of an existing superclass method and specify a return type that is some subclass
of the original return type.
It is best practice to use the @Override annotation when overriding a superclass method.
You will be given a partially completed code in the editor where the main method takes the name of a state (i.e., WestBengal, or AndhraPradesh) and 
prints the national flower of that state using the classes and methods written by you.
