Java's BitSet class implements a vector of bit values (i.e.:  () or  ()) that grows as needed, allowing us to easily manipulate bits while optimizing space (when compared to other collections). Any element having a bit value of  is called a set bit.

Given  BitSets,  and , of size  where all bits in both BitSets are initialized to , perform a series of  operations. After each operation, print the number of set bits in the respective BitSets as two space-separated integers on a new line.

Input Format

The first line contains  space-separated integers,  (the length of both BitSets  and ) and  (the number of operations to perform), respectively.
The  subsequent lines each contain an operation in one of the following forms:

AND 
OR 
XOR 
FLIP
SET
