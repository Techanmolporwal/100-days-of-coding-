JAVA reflection is a very powerful tool to inspect the attributes of a class in runtime. For example, we can retrieve the list of public fields 
of a class using getDeclaredMethods().

In this problem, you will be given a class Solution in the editor. You have to fill in the incompleted lines so that it prints all the methods of
another class called Student in alphabetical order. We will append your 
code with the Student class before running it. The Student class looks like this:

output:
You have to print all the methods of the student class in alphabetical order like this:

anothermethod
getName
setEmail
setId
......
......
some more methods
......
