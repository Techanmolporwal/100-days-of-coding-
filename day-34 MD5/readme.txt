MD5 (Message-Digest algorithm 5) is a widely-used cryptographic hash function with a -bit hash value. Here are some common uses for MD5:

To store a one-way hash of a password.
To provide some assurance that a transferred file has arrived intact.
MD5 is one in a series of message digest algorithms designed by Professor Ronald Rivest of MIT (Rivest, ); however, the security of MD5 has been severely 
compromised, most infamously by the Flame malware in . The CMU Software Engineering Institute essentially considers MD5 to be "cryptographically broken and\
unsuitable for further use".

Given an alphanumeric string, , denoting a password, compute and print its MD5 encryption value.
